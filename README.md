## <Readme-Generator>

## Description

This application allows the user to generate a readme.md file with all the necessary information inputed into the document using only the CLI. This project reminded me greatly of my previous experience working with C as it is dependant on using the CLI. It was an interesting opportunity to start delving into developing a responsive interaction through the CLI rather than with the traditional front end of a website. It allowed me to better understand tools like inquirer, the user input and storage of the input through the CLI, transporting the information between multiple files and then using that to display in a readme.md file. Check the readme in the Develop folder to see how the program works with a detailed Readme.

## Installation
The user will require access to an IDE such as VS Code (with integrated terminal) and Inquirer npm must be installed. 

## Usage
To install this application, clone this repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code.
Then right click the develop folder and open intergrated terminal.
To start the program then type in the CLI, node index.js.
This will then prompt the user with questions and then they will answer with the information they want in their respective parts of the readme. 
Once all the questions are answered it will create a readme.md file located in the develop folder.
