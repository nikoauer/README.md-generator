  The user will require access to an IDE such as VS Code (with integrated terminal) and Inquirer npm must be installed. 
  
  ## Usage
  To install this application, clone this repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code.
  Then right click the develop folder and open intergrated terminal.
  To start the program then type in the CLI, node index.js.
  This will then prompt the user with questions and then they will answer with the information they want in their respective parts of the readme. 
  Once all the questions are answered it will create a readme.md file located in the develop folder.
